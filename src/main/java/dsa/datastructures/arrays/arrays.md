## One Dimensional Array

## Multidimensional Arrays
- A multidimensional array is an element of another array
- A multidimensional array makes it easy to represent things that have more than one dimension.
- If a one-dimensional array can be represented as a single sequence of elements, then an intuitive way of representing a two-dimensional array is a matrix or a table. If you're working with matrices or tables in your program, it makes sense to present them in the form of two-dimensional arrays.
- Example of a two-dimensional array of ints with 3 rows and 3 columns:

	int[][] twoDimArray = {
	        {0, 0, 0}, // first array of ints, [0]
	        {0, 0, 0}, // second array of ints, [1]
	        {0, 0, 0}  // third array of ints, [2]
	};
